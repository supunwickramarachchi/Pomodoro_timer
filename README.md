# Pomodoro Timer

Welcome to the Pomodoro Timer! This is a simple timer application based on the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Features
- Timer Mechanism: The timer automatically switches between work sessions and breaks based on the Pomodoro Technique.
- Customizable Intervals: You can customize the duration of work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks.
- Visual Cues: The timer visually indicates the current session (work or break) and displays a countdown timer.
- Progress Tracking: Keeps track of completed work sessions and displays checkmarks for each completed session.
- Reset Option: Allows you to reset the timer and start a new Pomodoro session.
